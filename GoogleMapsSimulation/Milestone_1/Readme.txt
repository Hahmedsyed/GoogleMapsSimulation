Steps:
	Extract Project Files:
		Begin by extracting the project files to a preferred location on your system.
	Organize Files:
		Ensure that all project files are placed within the same folder for seamless execution.
	Execute adjacency_matrix:	
		Run the adjacency_matrix code to generate a visualization of the project data.
	Execute CityFinder Code:
		Run the CityFinder code to retrieve the path between the desired source and destination cities, for source and destination states give the two letter state code.
		
Additional Notes:
The project assumes that all files are kept in a single folder for optimal functionality.
Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed and configurations are set appropriately.
